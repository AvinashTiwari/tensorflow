This Sample which I have learned using Tensor Flow

## Sample 1
1_SallowNetwork_mnist_dataset
<br>
Technology used <br>
Anaconda , Juptyer , Phython <br>
Dataset used :- Mnist dataset 

<br>
Sampe for
cross_entropy :- Cost function 
<br>
Sigmoid_demo :- getting sigmoid
<br>
softmax_demo :- Recurrning learning to extend that we start predciting correctly
<br>
Avinash_Bit_smart_shallow_net_in_keras :- bit smart sallow network
<br>
Avinash_deep_net_in_keras :- deep nueural network using keras
<br>
Artifical_Neural_Network_ANN folder contains follwing sample
<br>
1_ contains sample for model run and creating prediction
<br>
2_ contains sample comparning with model run
<br>
3_ kfold sample which validate the data more proper predciting
<br>
4_ Grid search paramertized neural Network
<br>
convolution neural network 
<br>
Technology used Tensor flow , Keras
<br>
1_ Have sample which compare cat and dog image and prediction
*note if use all data one epoc will will 10000 sec so in sample it i just 5
on windows machince
<br>
2_ It predict image is dog or cat 
*note if use all data one epoc will will 10000 sec so in sample it i just 5
on windows machince

Som_self-organizing map
This example of self organizing Map on Unsupervised learning
<br>
It looks into credit card sample which had been approved and find customer who had cheated in data and got Credit card approved.

Boltzmann_Machines
This advance deep learning concept 
It is build on (1) Linux , (2) Phytocyh(Currently windows build is not there), (3)Anaconda (4) Spyder
