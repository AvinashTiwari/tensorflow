This Sample which I have learned using Tensor Flow

## Sample 1
1_SallowNetwork_mnist_dataset
<br>
Technology used <br>
Anaconda , Juptyer , Phython <br>
Dataset used :- Mnist dataset 

<br>
Sampe for
cross_entropy :- Cost function 
<br>
Sigmoid_demo :- getting sigmoid
<br>
softmax_demo :- Recurrning learning to extend that we start predciting correctly
<br>
Avinash_Bit_smart_shallow_net_in_keras :- bit smart sallow network
<br>
Avinash_deep_net_in_keras :- deep nueural network using keras
<br>
Artifical_Neural_Network_ANN folder contains follwing sample
<br>
1_ contains sample for model run and creating prediction
<br>
2_ contains sample comparning with model run
<br>
3_ kfold sample which validate the data more proper predciting
